# Welcome to Cat Chat!

**Catchat** is a new instant messaging app designed around the furry community!  It's very early in development, and currently, a demo can be found at [This Link](catchat.info)


# Progress

As mentioned above, CC is still very basic and barebones, and hopefully we plan to move from replit to our own servers. You can find the roadmap and todo list below

## Where we are:

So far, features in CC include:

	 - Messaging
	 - Admin/System Messages

## What we're still working on:

So far, CC is too barebones to even be called an app. From the essentials, we still have to set up things such as accounts and servers.

## Where we want to be:

CC is going to be a very expansive chatting platform, (hopefully) complete with the following features:

	 - GroupChats/Servers
	 - Direct Messaging
	 - Bot Support
	 - Sleek UI
	 - Event/Meet System
